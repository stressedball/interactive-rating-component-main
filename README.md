Another day, another challenge :)

I have doubts for the card's background-color, as the design template seems to have a gradient effect. My eyes could be lying to me though.

***I try to keep the challenges as simple as possible in terms of 'code infrastructure'. Which means using HTML/CSS and avoiding JS as much as possible***

Component not as responsive as it could be but changing sizes breaks the output flow IMO.
